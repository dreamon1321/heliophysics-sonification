# Heliophysics Sonification
User interface in HTML5 and JavaScript to hear heliophysics data and fiddle with the audio qualities (instrument, pitch). May use MIDI.js, p5.js, d3.js, node.js, etc. Very much a work in progress. 

## Origin Story
This project is born out of both the curious theory of implementing another method of perception -- the auditory sense -- in analyzing data and the desire to increase accessibility of data to the visually impaired. Research for this project has been abstractly present for several years, but hasn't been fully researched until June 2018. Needless to say, there's lots of info out there on auditory displays, sonification, and JS libraries pertaining to data visualization and the use of audio, but it's a matter of pulling all the invented wheels together to make a vehicle of data analysis.

## Project Features
This user interface should eventually include the following: 
*  Visual graph of the data
    *  Data taken from CDAWeb (http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/) in the form of a CSV file
*  Audio playback of the data
    *  Play/Pause button functionality
    *  Instrument dropdown menu
    *  Pitch dropdown menu
    *  Speed dropdown menu
    *  Audiosynchronous moving line on graph
    *  (Other features welcome by suggestion!)
